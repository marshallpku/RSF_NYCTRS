# This script constructs mortality tables for the NCTSERS model. 



# Death after retirement (General employees)
 # - RP-2014 Total Data Set for Healthy Annuitants Mortality Tabel.
 # - Rates for male members are multiplied by 108% for ages 50-78, and by 124% for ages greater than 78. 
 # - Rates for female members are multiplied by 81% for ages 50-78, and by 113% for ages greater than 78. 
 # - RP-2014 Total Data Set Employee Mortality Table (with no adjustments) is used for ages less than 50. 

# Death after retirement (Teachers and Other education employees)
 # - RP-2014 Total Data Set for Healthy Annuitants Mortality Tabel with white collar adjustment
 # - Rates for male members are multiplied by 92% for ages 50-78, and by 120% for ages greater than 78. 
 # - Rates for female members are multiplied by 78% for ages 50-78, and by 108% for ages greater than 78. 
 # - RP-2014 Total Data Set Employee Mortality Table (with white collar adjustment) is used for ages less than 50. 

# Death after retirement (Law emforement officers)
 # - RP-2014 Total Data Set for Healthy Annuitants Mortality Tabel.
 # - RP-2014 Total Data Set Employee Mortality Table (with no adjustment) is used for ages less than 50. 

# Death after retirement (survivors of decreased members)
 # - RP-2014 Total Data Set for Healthy Annuitants Mortality Tabel.
 # - Rates for male members are multiplied by 123% for ages greater than 50.
 # - RP-2014 Total Data Set Employee Mortality Table (with no adjustments) is used for ages less than 50. 

# Death after retirement (disabled members at retirement)
 # - RP-2014 Total Data Set for disabled Annuitants Mortality Tabel.
 # - Rates for male members are multiplied by 103% for all ages. 
 # - Rates for female members are multiplied by 99% for all ages.

# Death prior to retirement 
 # - RP-2014 Total Data Set Employee Mrrtality Table for general employees and law enforcement officers
 # - RP-2014 RP-2014 White Collar Employee Mortality Table for teachers and other education employees. 

# Mortality projection: all rates are projected from 2014 using generational improvement with Scale MP-2015.





# The construction of projected mortaltiy follows the procedure described in Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2014 Report(SOA, 2014, p22).
