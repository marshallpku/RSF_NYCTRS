# Modeling the Finances of the Teachers' Retirement System of the City of New York

This repository is for the project "Analyzing Risks and Issues Relating to the New York City Teachers' Retirement System", funded by the Equable Institute. 

## Project summary

This project will analyze costs and risks of the New York City Teachers’ Retirement System (NYC TRS) under current policies and underpotential alternative policies. It will place this analysis in the context of the New York City budget, including approximate ranges of how costs and risks of other public pension funds in New York City may affect the City budget. This is important because when NYC TRS suffers downside risks, or benefits from upside risks, other City pension funds are likely to face similar risks, and so the aggregate implications for the City budget are likely to be greater than those for NYC TRS alone.

In addition to the analytic work, the project will entail considerable outreach to and engagement with stakeholders in the New York City Teachers’ Retirement System, including stakeholders in New York City more broadly. Much of this outreach and engagement will occur during the analytic phases of the project, before a project final report. The project will culminate in a final report that includes the results of the analysis.
